The first C programming book “C Programming Language”
was published in 1978, written by
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
With the rapid growth of the C language for several years,
it was time to standardize the language and are also known
as ANSI C. The focus of the book is the C programming language,
however, the approach is general, so it can be extended to
all programming languages.
